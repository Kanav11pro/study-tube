# Website Fixes and Restoration Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines all the critical issues found and fixed in the StudyTube website after it was broken by previous changes. The main issues included RLS policy violations, database type mismatches, and subscription flow errors.

---

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Database Types Mismatch** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** The `/src/types/database.ts` file was incomplete and missing critical tables:
- `subscription_plans`
- `user_subscriptions`
- `subscription_requests`
- `user_roles`
- `referral_codes`
- `referral_signups`
- `platform_settings`

**Impact:** TypeScript errors, incorrect type inference, and potential runtime errors.

**Solution:** Completely rewrote `/src/types/database.ts` to match the actual database schema with all tables, Insert types, and Update types.

---

### 2. **RLS Policy Violations - Payment Flow** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Users couldn't submit payment requests due to "new row violates row-level security policy" error.

**Root Causes:**
1. RLS policies on `subscription_requests` table weren't properly configured
2. Storage bucket policies for payment screenshots had incorrect path parsing
3. Missing admin policies for managing subscriptions

**Solution:** Created comprehensive migration `/supabase/migrations/20251024000000_fix_rls_and_subscription_flow.sql` that:
- Fixed `subscription_requests` INSERT policy to use `TO authenticated`
- Updated storage policies to use `split_part(name, '/', 1)` for proper path parsing
- Added admin policies for INSERT and UPDATE on `user_subscriptions`
- Added admin UPDATE policy for `profiles` table

---

### 3. **Admin Panel Access Issues** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Admin panel couldn't properly manage subscriptions due to missing RLS policies.

**Solution:**
- Added `Admins can insert subscriptions` policy
- Added `Admins can update subscriptions` policy
- Added `Admins can update any profile` policy
- Fixed the `has_role()` function to use proper search_path

---

### 4. **Storage Bucket Configuration** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Payment screenshot upload was failing due to:
1. Missing storage bucket
2. Incorrect RLS policies using `storage.foldername()` which doesn't exist

**Solution:**
- Added code to ensure `payment-screenshots` bucket exists
- Rewrote storage policies to use `split_part(name, '/', 1)` for user ID extraction
- Added proper admin access to view all payment screenshots

---

### 5. **User Registration Flow** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** The `handle_new_user()` function had inconsistencies across migrations.

**Solution:** Updated the function to:
- Always create a referral code
- Always create default user role as 'user'
- Set default subscription_tier to 'free'
- Properly handle referral signup flow
- Use proper error handling and transaction management

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/types/database.ts`
- **Complete rewrite** to include all database tables
- Added proper Insert and Update types
- Aligned with actual database schema

### 2. `/supabase/migrations/20251024000000_fix_rls_and_subscription_flow.sql`
- **New comprehensive migration** fixing all RLS issues

- Fixed storage bucket policies
- Updated handle_new_user function
- Added performance indexes

## Payment Flow (Fixed)

### How It Works Now:
1. User navigates to Pricing page
2. Selects Monthly or Yearly plan
3. Clicks "Upgrade Now" → redirected to `/subscription-request`
4. User sees UPI details and payment instructions
5. User makes payment via UPI app
6. User fills form with:
   - Full Name
   - Email
   - Phone Number
   - UPI Transaction ID
   - Payment Date
   - Payment Screenshot (uploaded to storage)
7. Backend:
   - Uploads screenshot to `payment-screenshots` bucket ✅
   - Creates entry in `subscription_requests` table ✅
   - Status set to 'pending'
8. Admin reviews in Admin Panel → Approves/Rejects
9. On approval:
   - Creates/updates `user_subscriptions` entry
   - Updates user's `subscription_tier` to 'premium'
   - User gets access to premium features

### RLS Policies Applied:
- ✅ Users can INSERT their own requests
- ✅ Users can view their own requests
- ✅ Admins can view all requests

     - Referral code
     - User role ('user')
     - If referral used: Grant 1 month premium

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "new row violates row-level security policy"
**Solution:** Run the new migration to fix RLS policies

### Issue: Payment screenshot upload fails
**Solution:** 
1. Ensure storage bucket exists
2. Check RLS policies on storage.objects
3. Verify file path format: `{user_id}/{filename}`

### Issue: Admin panel access denied
**Solution:**
1. Verify user has 'admin' role in user_roles table
2. Check has_role() function is working
3. Ensure RLS policies include admin checks

### Issue: Subscription not activating after approval
**Solution:**
1. Check admin has proper INSERT policy on user_subscriptions
2. Check admin has proper UPDATE policy on profiles
3. Verify plan_id is correct

## Migration Instructions

### To Apply These Fixes:

1. **Backup your database** (important!)

2. **Run the migration:**
```bash
# Using Supabase CLI
supabase migration up

# Or manually via SQL editor in Supabase dashboard
# Copy contents of /supabase/migrations/20251024000000_fix_rls_and_subscription_flow.sql
```

3. **Verify migration:**
```sql
-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'subscription_requests';

-- Check storage policies
SELECT * FROM storage.policies;

-- Check functions
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname IN ('handle_new_user', 'has_role');
```

4. **Test the flow:**
- Create a test user
- Try submitting a payment request
- Login as admin and approve
- Verify user gets premium access
