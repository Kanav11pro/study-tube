```bash
cd /workspace
supabase migration up
```

#### Option 2: Manual Application
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Open `/supabase/migrations/20251024000000_fix_rls_and_subscription_flow.sql`
4. Copy the entire contents
5. Paste into SQL Editor
6. Click "Run"

### **Verify the Fix:**
1. Try creating a test user
2. Navigate to `/pricing`
3. Try submitting a payment request
4. Check if the error is gone

## 🔍 What Each Fix Does

### 1. Database Types (`/src/types/database.ts`)
- Added all missing tables (subscription_requests, user_subscriptions, etc.)
- Fixed TypeScript type errors
- Enables proper type checking

### 2. RLS Policies (Migration File)
- Fixed subscription_requests INSERT policy
- Added admin policies for managing subscriptions
- Fixed storage bucket policies for payment screenshots
- Updated handle_new_user() function

### 3. Storage Bucket
- Ensures payment-screenshots bucket exists
- Fixed path parsing for user-scoped access
- Added admin access to view all screenshots

---

## 🧪 Testing the Fixes

### Test Payment Flow:
1. Login as a regular user
2. Go to Pricing page (`/pricing`)
3. Click "Upgrade Now"
4. Fill in payment details
5. Upload a screenshot
6. Submit - **Should succeed now!** ✅

### Test Admin Panel:
1. Ensure your user has 'admin' role in `user_roles` table
2. Navigate to `/admin`
3. Check if you can see pending requests
4. Try approving a request - **Should work now!** ✅

## 🔐 Security Notes

All RLS policies now follow the principle of least privilege:
- Users can only access their own data
- Admins have special privileges (verified by role check)
- Storage is scoped to user IDs
- All functions use fixed search_path for security

---

## 📊 Database Schema

### Key Tables:
- **profiles** - User info + subscription_tier
- **subscription_requests** - Payment verification requests
- **user_subscriptions** - Active subscriptions
- **subscription_plans** - Available plans
- **platform_settings** - UPI details, pricing

### Subscription Flow:
```
User → Pricing Page → Payment Request → Admin Approval → Premium Access
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If payment request still fails:
1. Check if migration was applied: 
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'subscription_requests';
   ```
2. Check storage bucket exists:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'payment-screenshots';
   ```
3. Check user is authenticated:
   ```sql
   SELECT auth.uid(); -- Should return user ID
   ```

### If admin panel shows access denied:
1. Verify you have admin role:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
   ```
2. If not, grant admin role:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role) 
   VALUES (auth.uid(), 'admin'::app_role);
   ```
